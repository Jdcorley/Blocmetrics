# Blocmetrics was an app I created to allow users to track event data in other applications. 

## The users can register an application and attach the javascript method to an event in thier application and any interaction that triggers the even will send the data to Blocmetrics, to be recorded and displayed graphically. 

  ### Technologies Used:
    - Graphs implemented using chartkick gem.
    - Views were written using HAML.
    - Emails delivered through sendgrid.
